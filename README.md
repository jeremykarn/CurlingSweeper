This is an Apple Watch port of a a friend's Garmin Curling App: https://github.com/phil-mitchell/garmin-curling.  50% of all profit from this app will go to Phil.

This was mostly just a fun test of using Claude Code.  I didn't write a single line of code for this repository.  I cloned Phil's app and then asked Claude to port it to an Apple Watch version.  It took about 1.5 hours starting from signing up for a Pro plan and with no experience with XCode or Apple Watch development.
